# Exploratory Data Analysis Project
 ##Project Overview

####This project presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using Python.
####The objective is to understand the dataset, clean it, analyze relationships between variables, and visualize patterns to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Objectives

####Inspect dataset structure and data types

####Identify and handle missing values

####Generate statistical summaries

####Analyze correlations between features

####Create visualizations to better understand the data

 ##Technologies & Libraries Used

####Python

####Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

####NumPy – Numerical operations

####Matplotlib – Data visualization

####Seaborn – Advanced statistical visualizations

####Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
####1️ Data Inspection

#####Used info() to examine data types and structure

#####Used describe() to generate statistical summaries

####2️ Data Cleaning

#####Checked for missing values using isnull()

#####Removed or handled missing data where necessary

####3️ Correlation Analysis

#####Generated a correlation matrix using corr()

#####Visualized relationships using a heatmap

####4️ Data Visualization

#####Created plots to explore:

#####Data distribution

#####Relationships between variables

#####Key patterns and trends

 ###Results

#####Cleaned and structured dataset

#####Clear statistical understanding of features

#####Visual insights into relationships between variables

#####Improved interpretability of the dataset
